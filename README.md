# reaper-export-envelope

Export automation envelopes from the Reaper DAW. Add the export-envelope-samples.lua script to your Reaper Action list.
When run, the script exports the current time selection of the currently selected envelope to a .csv file.
One value is exported per sample, delimited by newlines.
